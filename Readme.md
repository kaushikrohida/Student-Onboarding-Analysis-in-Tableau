# Student Onboarding Analysis - Tableau Dashboard

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the onboarding experience of students using an e-learning platform by leveraging onboarding survey data. The primary outcome is the creation of an interactive Tableau dashboard, showcasing trends and insights regarding student onboarding experiences.

## Case Description

### Overview

In this project, you’ll tackle a real-world case and gain hands-on experience optimizing an e-learning platform’s onboarding feature for maximum student engagement.

### Objective

Your main goal is to generate visualizations that analyze students' interaction patterns with the platform’s onboarding service.

### The Challenge
